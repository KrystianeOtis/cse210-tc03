I am from Rigby, Idaho. I'm majoring in Software Engineering. This is my 5th semester at BYU-I.
I married my highschool sweetheart in 2017. We have 2 dogs named Hazel and Axel.

Grant Shirley

I am from Oceanside CA and I have lived there my entire life! I love it! Why?
Because I don't have to deal with that white stuff called snow. I'm not a big
fan of it, unless it involves ice skating or skiing. My favorite color is blue
and my favorite animal is a penguin, why because they are very adorable!


Colton Kramer:I am from Charlotte, North Carolina. I am studying Software Engineering. I enjoy rock climbing, spending time with my wife, and playing video games.


Melanie Monkurai

I love to music.
