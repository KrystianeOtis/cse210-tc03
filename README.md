Week 3 Team Challenge


Grant Shirley

I am from Oceanside CA and I have lived there my entire life! I love it! Why? 
Because I don't have to deal with that white stuff called snow. I'm not a big 
fan of it, unless it involves ice skating or skiing. My favorite color is blue
and my favorite animal is a penguin, why because they are very adorable!


Colton Kramer:I am from Charlotte, North Carolina. I am studying Software Engineering. I enjoy rock climbing, spending time with my wife, and playing video games.
